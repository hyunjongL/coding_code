# coding_code
This code codes a "very simple" code.

Currently it codes a code that initializes n variables.(Code has 5 but can be expanded to any number)
Rest of the code adds or subtracts variables and assign it to a variable.

Worked on to make loops and ifs.

Now need to think about how to prevent infinte loops( or if it is impossible to prevent it)
Also need to think about how to make a useful or meaningful code.
Below is an example of an output code.

### < code.py >

    a = 98
    b = -5
    c = 22
    d = -22
    e = 67
    if b < a:
        a = e + 21
        a = b + 35
        e = d - d
        while a > a:
            a = e + e
        if b > a:
            c = a + c
            b = d - b
            c = b - 79
            c = a - 7
    print(a, b, c, d, e)
