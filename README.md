# coding_code
This code codes a "very simple" code.

Currently it codes a code that initializes 3 variables.
Rest of the code adds or subtracts variables and assign it to a variable.

Ideas: We can think of making a "While loop" or "If statements".
How?: Have depth for a Loop or a Statement.
      Also, have a comparison for a Statement.

Now working on IF statements
